    <p>Welcome to my first ever game that I made with a partner, Bowen Drawbridge.</p>
    <p>My partner and I had a little over a month to draw up brainstorm an idea for a game, design the code for the game, and then pier program the code for the game together.</p>
    <p>My partner and I based our game off of the existing game "Galaga", the famous and classic 1980's game my parents grew up playing.</p>
    <p>Our game functions by the user (player) using the A and D keys on the keyboard to move the Bitmoji in such a way that the Bitmoji grabs as many monsters as possible.</p>
    <p>In order to score points, the player must grab as many monsters as possible with out letting any monster pass of the bottom of the screen or else for every monster that goes off the bottom of the screen, the players score will decrease by -1.</p>
