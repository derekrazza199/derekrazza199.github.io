        <h1> About me... </h1>
      <h2><p>As you already know, my name is Derek Razza. At the time of making this website, I am currently 19 years old and am in my freshman year at the University of Rhode Island. I was born and raised in Warwick Rhode Island and for high school I attended Bishop Hendricken High School. There, I was in the ambassadors program and played on the varsity golf team. I can say with confidence that those were the best four years of my life. </p>
      <p>Fun fact about myself, if you ask any of my friends and family they will all tell you that I have a burning passion of cars and i love cars way too much. I love everything about cars, I love talking about them, working on them, driving them, racing them (on a track of course).</p>
      <p>I also played baseball for 12 years of my life and love baseball but like with all things, you tend to get bored of it/them after a while. I also developed Tendinitis in my elbow which affected my throwing ability and constantly makes my elbow crack, which hurts. I also love being outside and love the outdoors, whether its fishing, playing baseball, basketball, swimming, etc.</h2>
